"""Topic remap contract — pure data, no launch / ROS imports.

This module is the single source of truth for the topic-name surface
each autonomy node is wired onto, for both the simulator (`/fsds/*`
bridge) and the real car (uDV micro-ROS node + Hesai driver).

It is deliberately free of any `launch` / `launch_ros` / `rclpy`
import so the contract can be unit-tested in a plain pytest
environment with no ROS installed (see bringup/test/test_topic_contract.py).
`launch_common` imports these constants and `autonomy_remaps()` to build
the actual LifecycleNode actions.

Remap tuple convention (ROS 2 `from:=to`): the FIRST element is the
topic name the node uses *in its own source code*; the SECOND is the
real topic it is rewritten onto. The "from" therefore differs per node
depending on what that node hardcodes — e.g. cone_detection_node
subscribes to "/fsds/lidar/Lidar1" in code, so its car remap "from" is
"/fsds/lidar/Lidar1", whereas odometry_filter_node subscribes to "/imu"
in code, so its "from" is "/imu". Getting this direction wrong silently
breaks the car (the node subscribes to a topic nobody publishes), which
is exactly why this table is pinned by tests.

# Verified against the live firmware (IFS08-DV-uDV, node `cubemx_node`,
# empty namespace) and the Hesai driver:
#
#   uDV   /imu           sensor_msgs/Imu          400 Hz  → direct (no remap)
#   Hesai /lidar_points  sensor_msgs/PointCloud2  ~10 Hz  → pure remap
#
# IMU is canonical `/imu` on BOTH sides: the firmware publishes `/imu` and
# odometry_filter_node / slam_node subscribe to `/imu` in code, so the car
# needs NO IMU remap (settled 2026-07-04 — standardised on `/imu`, dropping
# the old `/imu/data_raw` name). Only the LiDAR needs a car remap. The other
# EKF inputs are published by the uDV directly on their canonical names (the
# unit conversions moved into firmware):
#
#   /steering_angle  uDV converts its steering sensor DEG→RAD on-board
#                    and publishes /steering_angle (RADIANS) directly.
#   /motor_rpm       uDV reads the inverter (CAN) and publishes
#                    /motor_rpm (motor-shaft RPM) directly.
