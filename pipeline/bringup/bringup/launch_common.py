"""Shared launch-file helpers and IFSSIM topic remap constants.

Every launch file under `bringup/launch/` composes the same node-graph
fragments — management trio, autonomy lifecycle nodes, /fsds/* remap
table. Keeping the shared pieces here avoids three near-identical
copies drifting out of sync.

Public API used by the launch files:

  REMAP_*                IFSSIM /fsds/* surface → pipeline-side names.
                         Single source of truth.

  auto_active(...)       Build a LifecycleNode that auto-drives itself
                         from `unconfigured` to `active` at launch
                         start. Used for the management trio whose
                         action/service endpoints must be live before
                         mode_manager fans change_state out to the
                         autonomy nodes.

  autonomy_lifecycle(...) Build a LifecycleNode that parks in
                          `unconfigured` until mode_manager drives the
                          configure/activate transitions in response
                          to a StartMission/activate_mode call.

  autonomy_actions()     The pre-baked list of autonomy
                         lifecycle-nodes (odometry_filter,
                         cone_detection, slam, path_planning,
                         control) with their remappings. Bring-up
                         order is owned by mode_manager's registry.
                         Lets each launch file insert them with one
                         `actions += ...`.

  management_actions(include_sim_supervisor=True)
                         The management trio pre-baked with the right
                         remaps. The sim_supervisor flag toggles
                         between the sim layout (supervisor included,
                         sits between control_node and the bridge) and
                         the real-car layout (supervisor omitted, the
                         on-vehicle uDV handles the same role).
