"""
Car pipeline — on-vehicle build. mode_manager + mission_control +
management trio + autonomy lifecycle nodes (odometry through control),
wired onto the REAL car sensor/actuator surface instead of the IFSSIM
/fsds/* bridge.

What makes this the "car" build (vs sim_pipeline / full_pipeline):

  * autonomy_actions(profile="car") — only the LiDAR is remapped onto the
    Hesai (/lidar_points) topic; IMU is canonical /imu on both sides (no
    remap); the sim-only ground-truth taps are dropped.
  * NO car-side adapter nodes. The uDV (a micro-ROS endpoint) is the
    mission_control peer directly, over the stock-typed interface in
    topic_contract.py: it publishes /assi/state + /ami/mission and its
    sensors (/imu, /steering_angle in rad, /motor_rpm from the
    inverter), and consumes /dv/status + /ctrl/cmd (geometry_msgs/Twist)
    + /force_ebs (std_srvs/SetBool). mission_control reconciles the same
    surface here that sim_supervisor (the sim uDV emulator) provides in
    the sim — one identical mission_control in both worlds. The unit
    conversions + actuation scaling that the old car_sensor_bridge /
    car_supervisor did on the DVPC now live in uDV firmware. See
    docs/CAR_ADAPTATION.md.
  * No sim_supervisor (that's the sim's uDV emulator).

No IFSSIM / foxglove here — those are sim/dev concerns. The bag recorder,
by contrast, IS launched on the car when free_run is on: the always-on
data-collection floor records every powered-on session (see free_run below).

## free_run

`free_run` (default true) turns on the always-on autonomy floor: while the
uDV is powered on (heartbeat alive) mission_control brings the WHOLE autonomy
stack up — perception, SLAM, planning AND control — and records a rosbag,
even in AS OFF / manual driving with the ASMS unpowered, so data is captured
without ever arming the car. control_node runs so its would-be commands land
on /ctrl/cmd_internal (recorded) for pilot-vs-autonomy comparison, but the
pipeline does NOT relay them: /ctrl/cmd is published only in a live run, and
the uDV actuates only in AS Driving. At the go edge control_node is clean-
reset for the run (fresh state, no SLAM reset / Numba re-JIT). Flip it off
for a lighter-CPU competition build:
