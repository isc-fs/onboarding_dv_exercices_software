"""Pure Pursuit lateral controller.

Geometric path follower: pick a target point on the path at lookahead
distance Ld ahead of the rear axle, draw an arc that reaches it, command the
steering angle that produces that arc.

Curvature of the chasing arc:
    κ = 2·sin(α) / Ld
    δ = atan(L · κ)             # kinematic bicycle, L = wheelbase
    steer_norm = δ / max_steer

where α is the angle from the vehicle heading to the target point.

Adaptive lookahead: Ld = min(L_max, L_min + k·v) capped above by β·R_local
on curves, and floored at a small absolute minimum (0.5 m) so the chase
target never collapses onto the car. The L_min term is the *low-speed*
floor on straights — it intentionally does not reapply after the radius
cap, because on a hairpin tighter than L_min/β the radius cap is the only
thing keeping the chase target inside the curve. β ≈ 0.7 is the standard
Pure Pursuit rule of thumb (Coulter '92 §4; AMZ / MIT FSAE references).
R_local = 1 / max|κ| over the next lookahead window of the path; we read
κ from `ref.curvature` rather than recomputing. (#260)

Why Pure Pursuit (vs Stanley) for FS:
  - Stable at v→0 (no `softening_gain` denominator hack)
  - Naturally smooth — single geometric quantity, no PD on heading error
  - Cone-corridor following at 1–10 m/s is squarely Pure Pursuit territory

Reference frame: Path is published in `odom`, VehicleState pose is in `odom`.
We pick the target on the path geometrically (closest forward point past Ld
arc-length from the projected rear axle) and convert to body-frame heading.
