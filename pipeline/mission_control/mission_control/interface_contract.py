"""Stock-typed uDV ↔ mission_control interface — the single source of truth.

The DV pipeline and the "uDV" (the real micro-ROS endpoint on the car, or
sim_supervisor emulating it in the sim) exchange ONLY standard ROS 2
interface types, so the firmware needs no custom messages and no
micro-ROS library recompile. mission_control runs one identical reconciler
against this surface in both worlds; the sim/car difference is only *who*
plays the uDV.

  uDV → mission_control (uplink, the "request"):
    /assi/state   std_msgs/UInt8   AS state machine byte (FS-Rules T14.9)
    /ami/mission  std_msgs/Int32   selected AMI mission INDEX (0..9, raw)

  mission_control → uDV (downlink, the "ack" + command):
    /dv/status    std_msgs/UInt8   pipeline lifecycle byte — the stock
                                   stand-in for the old SetMission /
                                   RuntimeControl action Results
    /ctrl/cmd     geometry_msgs/Twist  normalised command:
                                   linear.x = throttle [-1, 1],
                                   angular.z = steering [-1, 1]
    /force_ebs    std_srvs/SetBool (service)  emergency-brake request

Both byte topics MUST be published at a steady cadence (>= ~2 Hz, not
edge-only): each is the other side's liveness heartbeat (a stale
/assi/state deactivates the pipeline; a stale /dv/status holds the uDV in
a safe state).

This module is pure data + pure functions — NO rclpy / launch imports —
so it unit-tests in plain pytest and can be imported by both
mission_control (the reconciler) and sim_supervisor (the emulator). The
same byte values are mirrored in the uDV firmware (C); this module is the
canonical Python source.
