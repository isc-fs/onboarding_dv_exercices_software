"""Cone-equation helpers used by the cone-fitting solvers.

The file used to be named for its original responsibility (RANSAC-based
ground-plane removal) but the live ground-removal path is now in
`ransac.py:ransac2`, called from `cone_detection.py:clustering_separation_rt`.
What survives here is just the parametric cone equation that
`two_phase_cone_detection.cone_fit_2params` and the solver-warmup path
in `cone_detection.warmup_numba_functions` need.

PR-B (chore/pipeline-extract-benchmarks) deleted ~480 LOC of dev-only
helpers: alternative cone fits (`ls_cone_fit`, `cone_fit`), benchmark
harnesses (`benchmark`, `performance_test`, `clustering_benchmark`),
visualization helpers (`plot_cone_vs_data`, `generate_cone_plot_points`,
`plot_3d_points`, `plot_clustering`), file-based offline pipelines
(`final_cone_result_file`, `ground_removal`, `read_lidar_data`), and
their now-unused imports (matplotlib, timeit, several sklearn cluster
backends, scipy.optimize.minimize/least_squares). None were called
from any production node, the launch files, or the runtime cone
detection path. Git history preserves them if they're ever wanted back.
