"""Numba-compiled RANSAC plane fit, used for ground-plane removal.

The live caller is `cone_detection.clustering_separation_rt`, which fits
the LiDAR ground plane on every scan before clustering the outliers
into cones. Tested for 2D and 3D data; extending to higher dimensions
would need changes to the cross-product step in the iteration loop.

    """RANSAC plane fit. Returns (inlier_mask, plane coefficients).

    Args:
        data: (N, dim+1) — already augmented with a leading column of 1s
            for the bias term; numba doesn't play nicely with the
            np.c_/np.stack we'd otherwise use to add it on the fly.
        m: number of points that define a candidate plane.
        prob: target probability that the chosen subset is outlier-free
            (refines the iteration budget after each improving sample).
        threshold: inlier residual threshold. If None, set to the
            median absolute deviation of the last column — same heuristic
            sklearn's RANSACRegressor uses, with absolute (not squared)
            error so it's robust when the last dim isn't the largest-
            variance one.
        max_iter: hard upper bound on iterations. Degenerate scans
            with no consensus fall through cleanly at this cap.
        iter_subsample_max: cap on points used in the RANSAC iteration
            loop (#247). Consensus scoring runs on at most this many
            points; the final inlier mask always uses the full cloud.
            Set to 0 or negative to disable subsampling (profiling only).
        initial_coefs: optional warm-start plane ``[bias, n_x, ..., n_z]``
            (e.g. the previous scan's result). Scored as candidate zero
            before the random loop: if it still explains the ground, the
            adaptive iteration bound collapses to a handful of iterations;
            if the scene changed, it loses the support comparison and the
            full random search runs as before. None or an empty array = no
            warm start.

    Returns:
        np.where-style index of inlier points in the full input cloud,
        and the plane coefficients [bias, n_x, n_y, ...] (last component
        is always positive — flipped at the end if necessary).
