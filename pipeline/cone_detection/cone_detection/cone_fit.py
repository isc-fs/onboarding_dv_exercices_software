"""
Cone fitting for traffic-cone-shaped clusters: z ≈ d - c * ||(x,y) - (a,b)||.

Production perception (see ``cone_detection.final_cone_result_rt``) uses
:func:`cone_fit_template_dispatch`: each cluster is fit twice with a
fixed-shape template — once for the FSAE small cone
(``c=_CONE_SMALL_C, d=_CONE_SMALL_D``) and once for the big orange marker
(``c=_CONE_BIG_C, d=_CONE_BIG_D``). The lower-residual fit wins, giving
``(a, b)`` and a class label in one shot. The template constants are
empirical, extracted from rosbag fits (see
``debug_tools/extract_cone_truth_params.py``).

Why templates instead of free 4-parameter VARPRO:
* On a vertical-beam LiDAR most clusters are essentially a line of points
  along the line of sight (zero perpendicular spread). A 4-parameter cone
  fit has a flat valley along that direction and either lands in the
  mirror-image basin (``c<0``) or returns the unmoved warm-start.
* The two FSAE cone classes are well separated empirically (``c≈5.0, d≈0.35``
  vs ``c≈5.5, d≈0.55``) and the rulebook guarantees only those two classes
  are on track, so freely fitting ``(c, d)`` adds noise without information.
* Type comes for free from the residual comparison — no separate downstream
  classifier needed.

Legacy fitters (kept for benchmarks, not on the hot path):
* :func:`cone_fit_varpro` — 4-parameter VARPRO (a, b, c, d).
* :func:`cone_fit_2params` — 2-parameter (a, b) with hardcoded
  ``c=5.5, d=0.35`` nominal.
* :func:`cone_fit_collinear` — type-aware closed-form fit for collinear
  clusters using the same template constants as the dispatch.
* :func:`cone_pos_geometric` — closed-form centroid + LiDAR-ray correction;
  still used as the warm-start for the template fits.

    """
    Fit z = d - c * sqrt((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2) by optimizing (a, b) with VARPRO.

    Warm-starts (a, b) from :func:`cone_pos_geometric` — the closed-form
    centroid-plus-LiDAR-ray estimator. That puts the optimizer inside the
    correct c>0 basin from step one without any hardcoded ``(c, d)`` fit
    nominals: the only prior used is the cone base radius
    (:data:`_CONE_BASE_RADIUS_M`), which is a physical property of the FSAE
    cone we're detecting, not a fit-shape parameter.

    Production calls reach this function only after the PCA-linearity
    dispatch in ``cone_detection.final_cone_result_rt`` has filtered out
    near-collinear clusters (those go to ``cone_pos_geometric`` directly),
    so the cluster always carries genuine perpendicular-to-line-of-sight
    information and a 4-parameter fit is well-posed.

    The inner step uses the smooth unconstrained 2x2 lstsq; the c>=0 / d>=0
    NNLS projection is applied only as a post-processing step on the final
    converged (a, b). The (a, b) bounds (cluster bbox plus
    :data:`_VARPRO_AB_BOUND_MARGIN_M`) remain as a safety net so the
    optimizer cannot wander into the inverted-cone "bowl" basin.
