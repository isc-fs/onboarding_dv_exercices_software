"""Adapter for the FaSTTUBe Formula Student path planning library.

Wraps `fsd_path_planning.PathPlanner` (https://github.com/papalotis/ft-fsd-path-planning,
MIT, by FaSTTUBe — papalotis is the maintainer's GitHub handle) to match the
input/output contract the ROS node expects: list of `Cone` + `Pose2D` in,
list of `PathPoint` (+ optional debug info) out.

Why FaSTTUBe replaces our Delaunay+walker planner (PR #243):
  - The walker was poisoned by spurious orange-classified cones in the cone
    soup (see fix/241 SLAM audit) — Delaunay edges through ghost orange cones
    looked cross-colour to the walker, so it picked midpoints on the wrong
    side of the track.
  - The walker also struggled at one-sided observation regions (PR #189) —
    when only one side's cones are visible, only same-colour Delaunay edges
    exist and the walker's midpoints sit on the outside arc.
  - FaSTTUBe sorts each side independently and matches across sides, so
    orange ghosts get dropped naturally and one-sided regions are inferred
    from the present side's geometry.

This adapter is intentionally thin. The real algorithm lives upstream;
we own the type translation, the empty/exception guards, and the body-frame
yaw recomputation the controller wants.

# exits) the extrapolation can run 30+ m past actual cone returns. The
# tail of the path is then geometrically unsupported — the controller's
# Pure Pursuit lookahead can land in that extrapolated region. Capping
# the published path at 12 m of arc length keeps the controller looking
# only at well-supported geometry. 12 m comfortably exceeds Pure
# Pursuit's adaptive Ld at any speed we'd reach at FS-Driverless events

    The library JIT-compiles ~90 ``cache=True`` kernels (cone sorting,
    cross-side matching, path parameterization) lazily on the first
    ``calculate_path_in_global_frame`` call. Without this warmup that
    compile lands on the first /Conos callback — mid-mission, while the
    car is already driving. Cost there: ~0.3-0.5 s when the on-disk cache
    is warm, tens of seconds when it is cold (fresh install, rebuilt
    volume, numba upgrade, or an unwritable cache location — see
    NUMBA_CACHE_DIR in deploy/dv-pipeline.service and docker-compose).
    Calling this from ``PathPlanningNode.on_configure`` moves the cost
    into Phase-1 ``warming_up``, where mode_manager's 120 s per-node
    budget (parallel fan-out, same as cone_detection's warmup) absorbs it.

    Replays the REAL adapter chain (cull → pack → plan) on a synthetic
    two-row corridor instead of poking kernels directly: Numba
    specializes per call pattern, so only the live call chain guarantees
    the live signatures get compiled (an argument left to its default is
    a different specialization than the same value passed explicitly).

    Uses a throwaway adapter instance: skidpad/acceleration planners are
    stateful, and the live instance must not see synthetic cone history.
    The module-level Numba dispatchers being warmed are shared, so the
