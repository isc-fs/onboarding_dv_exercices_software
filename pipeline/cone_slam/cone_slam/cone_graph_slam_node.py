"""Cone-graph SLAM node — PR B (cone observation factors + DA).

                       Phase 2 (#382): used to compute map→odom drift
                       correction. slam_node's pose is absolute (map
                       frame); supervisor's /odom is dead-reckoning
                       (odom frame); the difference is the drift to
                       absorb into the map→odom transform.

State machine:
    INIT_WAITING_IMU  → INIT_CALIBRATING (3 s) → SLAM_RUNNING

Lifecycle:
    INIT_CALIBRATING expects the car to be stationary. We accumulate
    IMU samples, then estimate accel/gyro biases as the mean (with
    gravity assumption (0,0,-9.81) for accel). Anchor x_0 at world
    origin and start the factor graph.

    SLAM_RUNNING: every LiDAR header.stamp triggers an IMU
    preintegration window since the last trigger, an ImuFactor between
    the prev pose and a new pose, and an iSAM2 update. PR B adds cone
    factors. PR C adds GPS.
